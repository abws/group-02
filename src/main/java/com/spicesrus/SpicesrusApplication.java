It is spiced with cumin seeds, caraway seeds, cayenne and paprika (our Harissa spice blend does the job perfectly), and is lovely served with a hunk of bread, or a warm pitta bread. Along with the similar Mexican Huevos Rancheros, this is one of our favourite Sunday brunch treats.

Tip the flour and sugar into a large bowl, add the butter and rub in to make a light breadcrumb texture. Spread this onto a baking sheet and place in an oven preheated to 190c for 15 mins, until lightly coloured.
4
Spoon the fruit compote into a baking tray, then top with the crumble mix and finish for 15 mins in the oven.
5
For the custard, put the cream and milk into a large pan and slowly bring it to just below boiling point (take care, eruptions are messy!) In a large bowl whisk together the egg yolks, vanilla sugar and cornflour.
6
Now add the warmed milk and cream, whisking constantly, before returning everything to the pan and heating gently, stirring all the time, until the custard thickens.

Our take is based on the Israeli version, which is always served with a blob of harissa-style hot sauce in the middle â€“ this procedure is highly recommended. Tinned chickpeas are far and away the easiest (and fortunately the best) to use for the recipe.

Whizz together, and while it is whizzing, pour in the olive oil then the lemon juice. The consistency of tinned chickpeas varies quite a lot, some come out drier than others, so you may need to add a splash of water (or more lemon juice).
3
You will need to blend the hummus for five minutes or so. Check the hummus for seasoning, and it is ready to serve. It will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, so hummus is great to make in advance for a lunchbox or tomorrow's sundowner snack.*/

The sauce is not hot by any means, more warm and aromatic with distinctive fruity notes. It has a marked sweetness, especially once the honey is added. The texture of the sauce makes for a wonderful contrast with the crunch of the chicken. This recipe is perfect as a midweek supper, and due to the mild, fruity flavour of the sauce kids will love it.

First make the sauce. Heat 1tbs sunflower oil in a saucepan and add the flour. Cook the mixture for under a minute before adding the Katsu curry blend. Stir this spiced mixture in and cook for a further minute.
2
Slowly pour in the water or chicken stock, stirring all the time to avoid any lumps. Add the honey, soy sauce and a bay leaf.
3
Bring the sauce to the boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer away for 15 minutes or so until the sauce has thickened to a bechamel-like consistency â€“ thick, but still pourable. At this stage you can add more water or stock for a more desirable consistency. You want to achieve a nice, thick, velvety smooth sauce. Remember to keep an eye on the pan and give it the odd stir to prevent sticking or burning.
4
Now for the chicken. To prepare, run a knife through the middle of the thick part of the breast and open it up â€“ this will ensure the chicken cooks evenly. Dredge the chicken first in the flour, then in the egg and lastly in the panko crumbs.
5
Heat an inch or two of sunflower oil in a heavy, deep frying pan. To check the temperature of the oil, throw in a morsel of bread â€“ when it sizzles and rises to the surface immediately, the oil is hot enough. Lay the breaded chicken into the oil and fry for 5 minutes or so on either side, until the chicken is golden and crispy. Of course with chicken ensure that it is thoroughly cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.
6
To serve, slice the chicken diagonally then smother it with your katsu sauce, alongside plain steamed rice and a crispy salad.
